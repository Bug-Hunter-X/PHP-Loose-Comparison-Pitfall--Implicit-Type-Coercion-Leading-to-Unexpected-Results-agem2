This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to unexpected behavior with loosely typed variables and implicit type coercion in comparisons:
```php
<?php
$value = "10";
if ($value == 10) {
  echo "Value is equal to 10";
} else {
  echo "Value is not equal to 10";
}
?>
```
This code will output "Value is equal to 10". Although it might seem correct at first glance, this implicit type conversion might lead to unexpected behavior. The double equals sign (`==`) performs loose comparison in PHP, which converts the string "10" to an integer before comparison.
